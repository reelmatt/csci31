    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This is a sample page for my first NodeJS project, done for assignment #2 of the CSCI e31 class at the Harvard Extension School.</p>
    <p>My name is Matthew, and I received my undergraduate degree in Film/TV post production. I currently work with education video content at Harvard. For the last year or so now I've been taking software engineering courses at the Extension school and was recently admitted into the graduate degree program.</p>
    <p>The CSS, and other portions of this code were first used in the intro project I did for CSCI e15 with Susan Buck.</p>
