# Assignment #6 - Angular

The description of this assignment can be found in Canvas at [Assignment #6]
(https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/54354/assignments/249115) (Spring 2019)

You should build your application in this repo cloned for you in Github
Classroom. You'll submit your github URL in Canvas.

## My submission

As noted in the assignment handout, this application focuses on Angular. The
source for the data comes from the Express application built for Assignment 5,
currently being served at
[http://167.99.149.212:8080/](http://167.99.149.212:8080/). Angular connects to
the app using the REST API through the FilmService class, found at 'api/films'
and displays the "Diary", or list, view from the Express version of "Film Logger".

To run the Angular app, clone this repo and open the site in a browser. On my
machine, the URL was [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
