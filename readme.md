# Assignment #6 - Angular

The description of this assignment can be found in Canvas at [Assignment #6](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/54354/assignments/249115) (Spring 2019)

You should build your application in this repo cloned for you in Github Classroom. You'll submit your github URL in Canvas.

## My submission

As noted in the assignment handout, this application focuses on Angular. The source for the data comes from the Express application built for Assignment 5,
currently being served at http://167.99.149.212:8080/. Angular connects to the app using the REST API through the FilmService class, found at 'api/films' and
displays the "Diary", or list, view from the Express version of "Film Logger". Authentication was not added to the REST API, nor to Angular, so the page displays
all films logged in the main Express app.
