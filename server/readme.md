## My submission

This assignment focuses on the REST API to access information about films from the database. The API handles all four CRUD operations and is demonstrated with a test page that outputs test logs via client-side Javascript. The web-app was changed to support the FilmService API, but should retain the same functionality. For information about authorization/authentication, please [reference the README from assignment 4](https://github.com/HarvardDCENode/assignment-4-reelmatt/blob/master/readme.md).

Instructions for how to run the API test can be found on the page where you run them:
[API Test](http://167.99.149.212:8080/api-test.html).
